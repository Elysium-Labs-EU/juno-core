## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started. With installer or without installer.

### With installer
1. Make a copy of the juno-core repository on your own account
2. In the folder where you copied the repository, run the command `npx create-juno-dev-env`
3. To use the cloud backend, ask to be added to the Google Test users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/peRDGMn9xa). If you want to run it locally, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Elysium-Labs-EU/juno-backend-service/blob/main/README.md)

### Without installer

1. Download the code for Juno and run yarn to install all necessary packages
2. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project
3. If you want to run the backend on your local machine, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Elysium-Labs-EU/juno-backend-service/blob/main/README.md) or skip to the next step.
4. Add `VITE_BACKEND_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_URL` to the `.env` file. If you want to use our hosted cloud backend, set `VITE_USE_LOCAL_FRONTEND_CLOUD_BACKEND=true` and `VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://juno-api.elysiumlabs.io`. And request to be added to the Google Test users via Discord
5. Run the app using `yarn dev`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
